# DS-ALGO-C++
## This is a repo for DS Algo in C++
Top algorithms –
Sorting:
sort

stable_sort
Sort elements preserving order of equivalents (function template )
partial_sort
Partially sort elements in range (function template )
partial_sort_copy

is_sorted 
Check whether range is sorted (function template )
is_sorted_until 
Find first unsorted element in range (function template )
nth_element
Sort element in range (function template )
- Insertion sort, Selection sort,
- Merge Sort, Quicksort
- Binary Search
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Lee algorithm | Shortest path in a Maze
- Flood fill Algorithm

## Top Data Structures –
- Along with above algorithms, every computer science student is expected to implement below data structures –
- Linked List Implementation | Part 1
- Linked List Implementation | Part 2
- Insertion in BST
- Search given key in BST
- Deletion from BST
- Stack, Queue
- Min Heap and Max Heap
- Graph Implementation using STL
- Graph Implementation in C++ without using STL
- Trie Implementation | Insert, Search and Delete
- Memory efficient Trie Implementation using Map | Insert, Search and Delete
- One is also expected to be familiar with other programming paradigms like Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Divide & Conquer, Greedy Algorithms and concepts like Hashing and Recursion.
